Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes they all classified it as a golden retriever, which it was.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, none of the model architectures did. AlexNet classified Dog_02 as koala, koala bear, kangaroo bear, native bear, phascolarctos cinereus, ResNet classified it as llama, and VGG classified it as afghan hound, afghan.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three correctly classified Frog_01.jpg and Coffee_mug_01.jpg as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Although ResNet was the only model to correctly identify the coffee mug as a coffee mug, VGG classified it as a cup which is pretty close. But, VGG was the only model to classify Dog_02.jpg as a breed of dog as it said it was an afghan hound, so I believe that makes it the best for image classification.
